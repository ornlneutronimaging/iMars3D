    Whe the image is rotated, scipy will return a larger image that 
    has borders around the original image. 
    4 triangles show about on the edge with zeros in them.
    since the tilt angle is always small, we can simply take 
    a square cut at the center of that image.

    so there are three squares:
    * original square A from the input image
    * the sqaure returned by scipy, B. it is larger than A, and it is at "angle"
      with respect to A
    * sqaure C to be the output image. it is at "angle" with respect to
      A, and parallel to B. it is the smallest.

    the sizes have the following relations
    B = A(cos theta + sin theta)
    A = C(cos theta + sin theta)
