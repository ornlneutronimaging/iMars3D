For this scenario, as soon as a full set of 3D acquisition is done (when all the rotation angle have been acquired)
iMars3D should be automatically triggered and reconstruct the data and export them into the IPTS-XXXX/shared/processed_data folder.

This scenario used to work and stopped working 2 years ago. Script used can be find in `/HFIR/CG1D/shared/autoreduce`
